# caridina ü¶ê

A [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client library written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org).

It is also a species of shrimp, one of them being named "crystal red". Crystal for the language, red for the Matrix's red pill.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     caridina:
       github: erdnaxeli/caridina
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

The API documentation is available [here](https://erdnaxeli.github.io/caridina/Caridina/ConnectionImpl.html).

### Connecting

Create a new connection object:

```crystal
require "caridina"

conn = Caridina::ConnectionImpl.new(
  "https://my-favorite-hs.example.org",
  "my access token",
)
```

You can also login to get a new access token:

```crystal
access_token = Caridina::ConnectionImpl.login(
  "https://my-favorite-hs.example.org",
  "@mybotuserid:my-favorite-hs.example.org",
  "my secret password",
)
```

### Sync

Now we can create a new channel, and tell the connection object to start syncing.
The sync responses will be streamed in the channel.

```Crystal
matrix = Channel(Caridina::Events::Sync).new
conn.sync(matrix)

sync = matrix.receive
```

You have now a [sync response](src/response/sync.cr).

If you don't want to go through the whole sync response by yourself (which is
understandable), we provide you a [Caridina::Syncer](src/syncer.cr) object.

```Crystal
syncer = Caridina::Syncer.new
syncer.on(Caridina::Events::Message) do |event|
  event = event.as(Caridina::Events::Message)
  # TODO: actually do something
end

syncer.process_response(sync)
```

> :warning: The syncer is a new feature still in development.
> It currently only supports events in the joined rooms timeline.
> To access to other events, you need to go through the sync response.

### Read event

The events in the sync response are all `Caridina::Events::Event` objects.
You need to restrict the type of an event object to access all its fields.

```Crystal
sync.rooms.try &.join.each do |room_id, room|
  room.timeline.events.each do |event|
    case event
    when Caridina::Events::Member
      # someone's membership changed
    when Caridina::Events::PowerLevels
      # some authorization changed
    when Caridina::Events::Messages
      # someone talked
    else
      # unknown event
    end
  end
end
```

Sometimes the event's content can be polymorphic too.
That is especially the case for message events.
By using again a `case` clause to `event.content` you can restrict its type to access all its fields.

### Send events

There is not a single method to send an event.
Instead this library provides a set of methods that correspond to different
actions you may want to do.
You usually do not need to worry about crafting the event to send.

> :warning: This part is in a early stage.
> Only a few methods are currently provided.

```Crystal
# join a room
conn.join("!room_id:matrix.org")
# send a message
event_id = conn.send_message("!room_id:matrix.org", "Hello, world!")
# edit a message
conn.edit_message("!room_id:matrix.org", event_id, "Hello, world!")
# send a read receipt
conn.send_receipt("!room_id:matrix.org", "$event_id:matrix.org")
# Use the typing notification as a loader
conn.typing("!room_id:matrix.org") do
  # Do some processing.
  # While we are in the block, a typing notification will be shown on the given
  # room.
  conn.send_message("!room_id:matrix.org", "All done!")
end
```

## Development

Install the dependencies with `shards install`.

* `make test` runs the tests
* `make lint` runs the formater plus a linter
